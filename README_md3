1️⃣ Two Sum (Array)
2️⃣ Kadane’s Algorithm – Maximum Subarray Sum

1️⃣ Two Sum (Array)
🔹 Problem

Given an array and a target, check if any two numbers sum to the target.

🧠 Python Code (5 lines)
a=[2,7,11,15]; t=9
s=set()
for x in a:
    if t-x in s: print(True); break
    s.add(x)

📖 Explanation

We use a set to store numbers we have already seen.

For each number x, we check if target - x exists in the set.

If yes → pair found.

If no → store x and continue.

⏱️ Interview Insight

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

🎤 How to Explain in Interview

“I used hashing to reduce the time complexity from O(n²) to O(n) by storing visited elements.”

2️⃣ Kadane’s Algorithm (Maximum Subarray Sum)
🔹 Problem

Find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.

🧠 Python Code (4 lines)
a=[-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1]
s=m=a[0]
for x in a[1:]:
    s=max(x,s+x); m=max(m,s)
print(m)

📖 Explanation

s stores the current subarray sum.

At each element, we decide:

start new subarray (x)

or extend previous (s + x)

m keeps track of the maximum sum found so far.

⏱️ Interview Insight

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)

🎤 How to Explain in Interview

“Kadane’s algorithm uses dynamic programming to track the best subarray ending at each index.”

🎤 FAANG Interview Round (Professional Answers)

Q1. Why is Two Sum important?
A: It tests hashing and optimization from brute force to linear time.

Q2. Can Two Sum be solved without extra space?
A: Yes, using sorting + two pointers, but hashing is faster.

Q3. What does Kadane’s algorithm solve?
A: Maximum sum contiguous subarray.

Q4. Why Kadane is O(n)?
A: Each element is processed exactly once.
