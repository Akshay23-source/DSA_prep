1️⃣ Palindrome Check
2️⃣ String Reverse

1️⃣ Palindrome Check
🔹 Problem

Check whether a given string is a palindrome
(A string that reads the same forward and backward)

🧠 Python Code (2 lines)
s = "madam"
print(s == s[::-1])

📖 Explanation

s[::-1] creates the reversed version of the string.

We compare the original string with its reverse.

If both are equal → it is a palindrome.

⏱️ Interview Insight

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n) (new reversed string)

🎤 How to Explain in Interview

“I reverse the string using slicing and compare it with the original to check for palindrome.”

2️⃣ String Reverse
🔹 Problem

Reverse a given string.

🧠 Python Code (1 line)
s = "hello"
print(s[::-1])

📖 Explanation

[::-1] tells Python to:

Start from the end

Move backward one step at a time

It returns a new reversed string.

⏱️ Interview Insight

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

🎤 How to Explain in Interview

“Python slicing allows reversing a string in a single readable line.”

🎤 FAANG Interview Round (Professional Answers)
