1️⃣ Anagram Check
🔹 Problem

Check if two strings are anagrams
(They contain the same characters with the same frequency)

🧠 Python Code (2 lines)
s1="listen"; s2="silent"
print(sorted(s1)==sorted(s2))

📖 Explanation

sorted(s1) sorts characters of the first string.

sorted(s2) sorts characters of the second string.

If both sorted lists are equal → strings are anagrams.

🧠 Simple Example (Think Like This)

"listen" → ['e','i','l','n','s','t']

"silent" → ['e','i','l','n','s','t']

Same characters → Anagram

⏱️ Interview Insight

Time Complexity: O(n log n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

🎤 Interview Explanation

“I sort both strings and compare them. If they match, the strings are anagrams.”

2️⃣ Substring Basics
🔹 Problem

Print all substrings of a string.

🧠 Python Code (4 lines)
s="abc"
for i in range(len(s)):
    for j in range(i+1,len(s)+1):
        print(s[i:j])

🖥️ Output
a
ab
abc
b
bc
c

📖 Explanation

A substring is a continuous part of a string.

Outer loop selects the start index.

Inner loop selects the end index.

s[i:j] extracts the substring.

⏱️ Interview Insight

Time Complexity: O(n²)

Used in:

Sliding window

Longest substring problems

🎤 Interview Explanation

“I fix a starting index and expand the ending index to generate all continuous substrings.”

🎤 FAANG Interview Round (Professional Answers)

Q1. What is an anagram?
A: Two strings that contain the same characters with the same frequency.

Q2. Difference between substring and subsequence?
A: Substring is continuous; subsequence may skip characters.

Q3. Can anagram be solved without sorting?
A: Yes, using hashing (frequency count).

Q4. Where are substrings used?
A: Sliding window, pattern matching, longest substring problems.
