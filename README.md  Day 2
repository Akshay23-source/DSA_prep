1️⃣ Array Traversal

Traverse (visit) and print all elements of an array.

📖 Explanation

Array traversal means visiting each element once.

for x in a goes through elements one by one.

print(x) prints the current element.

⏱️ Interview Insight

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)

🎤 How to Explain in Interview

“I traverse the array once using a loop to access and process each element.”

2️⃣ Reverse Array (Basic)


Reverse the given array.

)

📖 Explanation

[::-1] means:

start → end

step = -1 (reverse direction)

It returns a new reversed array.

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n) (new array created)

🎤 How to Explain in Interview

“I used Python slicing to reverse the array in linear time.”

🎤 FAANG Interview Round (Professional Answers)

Q1. What is array traversal?
A: Accessing each element of an array exactly once to read or modify it.

Q2. Can arrays be traversed backwards?
A: Yes, by iterating from the last index to the first.

Q3. Is slicing the best way to reverse an array?
A: It’s concise and readable, but uses extra space.

Q4. How to reverse without extra space?
A: By swapping elements using two pointers.
